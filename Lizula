{Backstory:
  Lizula was a young monster when all of her kind dissapeared. She had stumbled accross a door in Waterfall that wasntthere before. Inside, she found a man who changed
  her life. He gave her a hand crafted solution everyday to keep her on her feet. But it did something bad to her mental health. She would grow hungry for the dust of 
  other monsters. Soon, she became a mass killer, enjoying her time being one. She did not know that what she was doing was bad. She likes to "play games" with other
  monsters. And by "play games," I mean if she wins, the monster will become her meal.
